# Air-Passenger-time-series-analysis-forecasting
This project analyzes monthly air passenger data (1949-1960) to explore trends and seasonality. Using Python, the time series is decomposed and log-transformed to stabilize seasonal fluctuations. A linear regression model is then used to predict future passenger numbers based on past data.
